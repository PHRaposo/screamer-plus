;;;; Screamer-Plus: A modernized constraint logic programming library for Common Lisp
;;;;
;;;; Screamer-Plus is an extension of constraint propagation in Screamer,
;;;; built upon a fundamental redesign of the core functions `funcallv` and `applyv`
;;;; introduced in version 4.0.1 of Screamer.
;;;;
;;;; This new foundation enables automatic constraint propagation, eliminating the
;;;; need for manual noticers and simplifying function/macro definitions.
;;;; As a result, many of the macros and functions originally found in Screamer-Plus
;;;; (by Simon White) — such as `CARV`, `CDRV`, `IFV`, and others — have been
;;;; entirely rewritten or reimagined with cleaner semantics and greater efficiency.
;;;;
;;;; Some function names and general ideas are inspired by the original Screamer-Plus
;;;; by Simon White, but all code in this package is original unless otherwise noted.”
;;;;
;;;; Contributions, feedback, and extensions are welcome.
